#IRC Ruleset
#### Draft rev 2013-01-01

The following ruleset is a draft outline of the rules for the SpigotMC IRC network. Whilst these rules may be completely disparate from the final versions, at this point in time they will be enforced as is. irc.spi.gt is a privately owned network, and as such any and all additional enforcement is entirely up to the network staff's discretion.

###General
* Do not attempt to gain unauthorized access to channels.
* Do not impersonate other users or organizations.
* Do not spam channels or users (Flooding).
* Do not harass other users or channels.
* By default, only 5 connections are allowed per address. Exceptions can be granted on a case-by-case basis upon request in #staff.
* Any attempt to create a disturbance across multiple channels may result in removal from the network at the discretion of the staff.


###Channels and Users
* Channels are monitored solely by the channel operators and owners. There should rarely be a need for network staff to intervene in a channel related issue.
* At this point in time we will be attempting to police on-topic channel registration in line with the freenode policy. You may view the policy here: https://freenode.net/policy.html.
* Do not create/register a channel or group/register a nickname for the sole purpose of preventing another user from having it (squatting/juping). The channel or name in question may be dropped from your control.
* Network staff may intervene in any situation where a channel or its name could be interpreted as malicious, inappropriate, misleading, or otherwise harmful to the network or its users (at the staff’s discretion) regardless of the channel’s namespace. 
* Continuously evading a channel ban may result in network staff intervening.

###Bots
* Bots should be set to user mode +B to designate them as a bot to the network.
* Bots should be set to Voice (+v) in channels to prevent them from triggering anti flood services.
* Channel management bots should be set to half-op (+h) or higher and should be monitored by channel staff to prevent abuse.
* Bots should be monitored at all times by channel staff. If they are not being actively monitored, they should be muted and have their channel powers revoked temporarily to prevent abuse.
* While bridge bots are encouraged, they should not create a new connection to the spi.gt network for each user on the other end of the bridge.
* Bots should not be created or used on this network as a means to create harm or perform other malicious activities to the spi.gt community or any other community or organization.
* If you have questions regarding whether or not a bot would be considered acceptable on the network, please stop by #staff and we can assist on whether it would fit on this network or not.

###Services
* Services are meant to help improve the life of the network. Do not abuse or spam them.
* Do not use services in an attempt to brute force another users nickserv credentials or gain unauthorized entry to a channel.
* If you have questions regarding appropriate usage of services or how to use various services commands, please stop by #help and we can assist.

###Misc
* Botnets and malicious activities are strictly prohibited.
* If your activity is regarded as illegal in your country or in one of the countries the network servers reside in (JP, NL, UK, US), it should not be on this network. 
* If you are running a bouncer service, it can help to let network staff know your IP block range to prevent block wide network bans in case an issue arises.
* Network staff decisions are final and rules will be enforced as the network staff interpret them, leniency may be given either way at the discretion of the staff.
* If you have any questions please stop by #help to get them resolved. If you have questions regarding the rules stated here, please stop by #staff and we can clear up any concerns you may have, as the network staff interpretation may be different from your own.
